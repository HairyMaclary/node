Function Constructors

A function constructor is a normal function that is used to create objects.  If you use the new keyword the 'this' variable points to a new empty object, and that object is returned from the function automatically. 

Because 'this' has been automaticaly created then we can attach things to it inside the function before it is returned:

    function Person (firstName, lastName) {
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }

    var john = new Person('John', 'Doe');

It's also possible to add to this object's prototype (see 'prototype chain' - in js inheritance is from other objects, not a class):

    Person.prototype.greet = function() {
        // use 'this' so that we refer to the object and not some variable (so don't use an arrow function here)
        console.log('hello ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
    }

The naming here is a little confusing. This prototype is the prototype of any object created from the Person function. It is not the prototype of the constructor function. So all objects created from this function constructor can have access to this greet method.

The js engine will now search down the prototype chain for this method:

    john.greet();


If you ever want to see the prototype for an object use __proto__ :

    // not recommended for produciton code
    console.log(john.__proto__);  // { greet: [function] } 

The es6 version of a function constructor is syntactic sugar. Classes in JS are not the same as they are in other languages.
    
    'use strict';

    class Person {
        
        // on each object
        constructor (firstName, lastName) {
            this.lastName = lastName;
            this.firstName = firstName;
        }

        // on the prototype that each object shares
        greet() {
            console.log('hello ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
        }
    }

    // object created the same way
    var john = new Person('John', 'Doe');

Primitive Value: any value that is not an object. These are passed by value into functions.

                Node

******************************************


Javascript is quite a high level language. Functionality like memory menagement is abstracted away. Also, because js was created for use in browsers it lacks some other common functionality such as modules and sneding files around. V8 is an open source c++ applicaiton that converts JS into machine code instructions for a variety of common microprocessor arcitectures. It is thus a JS engine, and it also meets all the ECMA script specifications for a JS engine. The advantage of v8 is that it has hooks so that it can be embedded in other c++ applicaitons. Node is such an application. It takes v8 and extends so that JS can be given extra functionality. This allows JS to be used outside of the browser. In particular it gives JS enough funcitonality to be used on a server (the client-server model is common, and the best example is on the internet, which used http to communicate between clients and servers). A server is connected to the internet and offers services.

Some features missing from plan js:

- better way to organise code into reusable pieces - ie modules
- dealing with files
- databases
- communicate over the internet
- accept requests and responses
- deal with work that takes a long time



Modules 
----------------------------------

A module is a reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentially impact other code. Javascript did not orignally have this feature (although ECMAscript 6 spec does require it now). Node does this with 'CommonJS modules'.

CommonJS modules are an agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured. 

Node supplies a built in function for importing modules called 'require('./filePath')'. 

This will make any code that is invoked within that required file run. However any functions from that file can't just be called. This is to prevent naming collisions.

So to call functions from the required file we have to use 'module.exports' in the required file. 

greet.js:

    // this line runs when greet is required in app.js. You don't even need to assign require to a variable
    console.log('Due to require(), this appears automatically in app.js');

    // this will not run in app.js unless we assign it to module.exports.
    var greet = function() {
        console.log("hello");
    };

    module.exports = greet;

app.js

    // to just get that first line from greet running
    // require('./greet');

    // now we use the idea that the require function returns 
    // module.exports.
    const greet = require('./greet');

    greet();

To explain how modules work in nodejs we first have to look at scope.

Scope: where in code you have access to a particular variable or function. 

Scope example with an IIFE, that shows how JS devs once faked up modules:

    var firstName = 'Jane';

    // the () around the function turn it into an expression that the engine
    // then holds and waits to see what you do with it. We execute it.
    
    (function () {
        var firstName = 'John';
        console.log(firstName);
    })();

    console.log(firstName);

    // john
    // Jane

So firstName in the function is protected from firstName from the global scope.

`require` is a function that takes a path. When you require a module in node, node wraps the code in your module within an IIFE. This protects the variable in a new scope, which is then passed into the v8 engine. module.exports is then returned.

If require() cannot find a file that matches it's string argument it then looks for a folder of the same name. Then it will look for an index.js file within that folder. So you can require a number of files in the index.js, and include there return values in one module.exports object. Then, from say app.js, just require the folder that index.js lives in. You can run functions from any of the original files from a single object. 

If `require()` is given the path of a JSON file (wich is really just a text file in JSON format - no methods and property names/keys in quotes), then that JSON string is returned back as a JSON object. 

Common Module Patterns


When node begins parses through a module, module.exports is first created as an empty object. So if you have just a function you are returning then just assign the function definition right to module.exports :

greet.js:

    module.exports = function() {
        console.log('hello');
    }

app.js:

    var greet = require('./greet');
    greet();


Also, because require is returning back our module.export as an object, often people use dot notation.

app.js:

    var greet2 = require('./greet').greet;
    greet2();


We can also employ other ways to make objects such as a function constructor.

greet.js:

    function Greetr() {
        this.greeting = 'Hello World!';
        this.greet = function() {
            console.log(this.greeting);
        }
    }

    // replace the empty object with our own object
    module.exports = new Greetr();

app.js:

    const greet = require('./greet');
    greet.greet();


However, we have to be careful when generating what looks like two different objects:

    const greet1 = require('./greet');
    greet1.greeting = 'Changed Hello World'

    const greet2 = require('./greet');
    greet2.greet();  // Changed Hello World


Here, eventhough it looked like we 'newed up' two different objects, the variables actually hold a reference to the same object. `require` actually caches a return object for each file name.

An alternative, and 4th pattern, is to just place a reference to the constructor function in module.exports and let the `new` happen in app.js:

    module.exports = Greetr;

app .js:

    const Greetr = require('./greet');
    const greet1 = new Greetr();
    greet1.greeting = 'Changed Hello World';

    const greet2 = new Greetr();
    greet2.greet();  // 'Hello World!


The next pattern is very popular and useful:

greet.js:

    var greeting = 'Hello world!';

    function greet() {
        console.log(greeting);
    }

    module.exports = {
        greet: greet
    }


app.js:

    const greet = require('./greet').greet;
    greet();  // 'Hello world!'

So we no longer have access to the greeting variable in greet.js, but we can still see it being applied. We essentialy have a private variable. This is called the 'revealing module pattern': exposing only the properties and methods you want via a returned object. This is a common and clean way to structure and protect code within modules.


Exports vs module.exports.

In your module you can actually use 'exports' instead of module.exports (exports is the parameter name and module.exports is the argument for the IIFE that is wrapped around the code in your module). Both variables point ot the same object in memory. However, exports is tricky to use. If you use an assignment at the top level of the object then you are creating a new object and thus a new reference. It's a lot easier to never use it.



Requiring Native (Core) Modules

Native modules come from the lib folder in node. They are the core of the JS side. You can see all the native modules in the node API. Some need to be explicitly imported, ie `required1 and some do not. You can look in lib to see the file name and work out the path string you will need. However, you don't need a full file path. Just the filename will do. Eg for the Utilities module:

    var util = require('util'); // for libs/util.js

If you happen to have one of your own modules with the same name then using the path separator fill fix the problem: require('/util'). But this is not reccommend anyway since it may lead to confusion.

Some of these modules are wrappers for c++ code and some are just js that you could have written yourself (but why bother?). Here we use the utilities module to date stamp, format and log a variable:

    const util = require('util');
    var name = 'Tony';
    var greeting = util.format('Hello, %s', name);
    util.log(greeting); // 13 Dec 15:28:09 - Hello, Tony 



Modules and ES6

ES6 modules are also suported in v8 (but not node). Eg:

greet.js:

    export function greet() {
        console.log('Hello');
    }

app.js:

    import * as greetr from 'greet';
    greetr.greet()





Events and the Event Emitter
---------------------------------------

Many core node js modules are built upon this concept.

Events in nodejs are:

    'Something that has happened in our app that we can repsond to'.

In nodejs we actually talk about two different kinds of events. On one side we have system events. They come from the c++ side of the nodejs core thanks to a library called libuv. These are events that have come form the computer system, like "I've finished reading a file", or "I've recieved information from the internet". These are events that JS did not originally have. 

On the other side, in the JS core, we have custom events. These are completly different and are events that you can create for yourself. They are created in  an area is called the 'Event Emitter'. 

Sometimes system events are sent on as custom events, so that they appear to be the same thing. But, they are not. 

The js side is actually faking it. They are not real events. JS has no event concept or object. We create our own event library with the techinique that the node event emitter uses. 

One key to understanding the event emiter is recalling that I can use string to dynamically access changing properties in an object:

    var obj = {
        greet: 'Hello'
    }
    // dot notation using the property name / key
    console.log(obj.greet);  // Hello

    //square bracket using the property name / key
    console.log(obj['greet']) // Hello

    // square brackets using a variable to hold the property name
    var prop = 'greet';
    console.log(obj[prop]); // Hello


You also need to recall that array are collections, and since functions are first class objects they too can be included in an array.

    let arr = [];

    arr.push( () => {
        console.log('1');
    });

    arr.push( () => {
        console.log('2');
    });

    arr.push( () => {
        console.log('2');
    });

    arr.forEach((fn) => {
        fn();
    })

    // 1
    // 2
    // 3

In this emiter example we will build our own simple version of the node event emitter. We will be able to see that an event has happened and then repond to it. 

Inside the ee we will have an `on` method. 'on' is a common name for an event listener because it reads nicely. EG I might say 'on a file being opened' or 'on a message being recieved'.

The on method then takes two arguments. One is for the type of event and the other is an event listener.

'Event Listener': code that responds to an event. In JS the event listener code is usually a function. When the event happens this code is invoked. You can have more than one listener for the same event. 

emitter.js:

    // could also use a class contructor to make this object
    // we want to be able to create multiple emitters.
    function Emitter() {
        this.events = {};
    }

    // add an "on" method to the protoype of all objects created from the function constructor
    Emitter.prototype.on = function (type, listener) {

        //if the type property already exists then good, otherwise make a new array.
        this.events[type] = this.events[type] || [];
        
        // now push the listener function into the array
        // we are building up an array of functions. One array for each event type.
        // onBlah: [function() {...}, function() {...}, ... }
        this.events[type].push(listener);
    }

    // now we want to say that something happened; we emit an event.
    Emitter.prototype.emit = function (type) {
        // If I have the type of event on my object, i'll loop over the 
        // associated array and execute each listener function
        if(this.events[type]) {
            this.events[type].forEach(listener => {
                listener();
            })
        }
    }

    module.exports = Emitter;



app.js:

    const Emitter = require('./emitter');

    let emtr = new Emitter();

    // Add some listeners

    // say whenever a greet happens we want to do something.
    emtr.on('greet', () => {
        console.log('Somewhere, someone said hello.');
    });

    // And this is another thing to do when a greet occurs
    emtr.on('greet', () => {
        console.log('A greeting occured!');
    });

    // simulate the event:
    console.log('Hello!');

    // let the application know that a greet event happened
    emtr.emit('greet');

You can check out the real event framework in lib/events.js. 'On' is an alias for `addEventListener`.

To re-write our example so that it uses the real event framework just change the import statement in app.js:

    const Emitter = require('events');

TO prevent magic strings we also create and require a config.js file:

config.js:

    module.exports = {
        events: {
            GREET: 'greet',
            FILESAVED: 'filesaved',
            FILEOPENED: 'fileopened'
        }
    }


Magic String: a string that has some special meaning in our code. They make it easy for a typo to cause a bug, and hard to track down that bug. It's just a string, not a variable. Relying on a string to be the basis for the logic in your code is dangerous.


So out final app.js is:

    const Emitter = require('events');
    const events = require('./config').events;

    let emtr = new Emitter();

    // Add some listeners

    // say whenever a greet happens we want to do something.
    emtr.on(events.GREET, () => {
        console.log('Somewhere, someone said hello.');
    });

    // And this is another thing to do when a greet occurs
    emtr.on(events.GREET, () => {
        console.log('A greeting occured!');
    });

    // simulate the event:
    console.log('Hello!');

    // let the application know that a greet event happened
    emtr.emit(events.GREET);


Aside on Object.create()

Object.create takes an object. It then makes a new object and set the argument as the new object's prototype.

    const Person = {
        firstName = "",
        lastName = "",
        greet = function() {
            console.log('Hello ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName);
        }
    }

    // john has Person as a prototype but it creates it's own name variables
    // so that the JS engine is not looking for them up the chain
    let john = Object.create(Person);
    john.firstName = "John";
    john.lastName = "Doe";

    // jane share the same prototype as john
    let jane = Object.create(Person);
    jane.firstName = "Jane";
    jane.lastName = "Doe";


Inheriting from the Event Emitter

We know about several inheritance approaches (ie ways to set up the prototype chain). Function constructors, extending a class and Object.create().

Within util.js (the utilities module in the node library), there is a method called inherits. This allows us to give set up an entire node library object, like the event emitter module, as the prototype of one of our own contructors. That is, a node module becomes the prototype of a constructor. The first argument is your custom constructor and the second is the module that will become the prototype.


Under the hood it looks a little like 

    myConstructor.prototype = Object.create(superContructor.prototype);


app.js:

    var EventEmitter = require('events');
    var util = require('util');

    function Greetr() {
        this.greeting = 'Hello World!';
    }

    // The prototype for objects created from EventEmitter will also be the prototype of the prototypes
    // created for all objects created from Greetr
    util.inherits(Greetr, EventEmitter);

    // You can still as your own methods and properties
    Greetr.prototype.greet = function(data) {
        console.log(this.greeting + ': ' + data);

        // And you can access EE methods too (which are on 'this' - 
        // the created object- don't call EventEmitter.emit because
        // EventEmitter is a constructor and not your object)
        // Here we use an optional argument in emit. Emit automatically
        // passes extra arguments into the event listeners
        this.emit('greet', data);  // normally don't use a magic string
    }

    const greeter1 = new Greetr();

    greeter1.on('greet', function(data) {
        console.log('Someone greeted: ' + data);
    })

    greeter1.greet('Tony');

Here is the same code converted to es6 (the call to super is discussed further below).

greetr.js:

    'use strict';

    var EventEmitter = require('events');

    // use `extends` instead of util.inherits(Greetr, EventEmitter);
    module.exports = class Greetr extends EventEmitter {
        constructor() {
            super(); // get specific object properties
            this.greeting = 'Hello World!';
        }

        greet(data) {
            console.log(this.greeting + ': ' + data);
            this.emit('greet', data);  // normally don't use a magic string
        }

    }

app.js

    var Greetr = require('./greetr');

    const greeter1 = new Greetr();

    greeter1.on('greet', function (data) {
        console.log('Someone greeted: ' + data);
    })

    greeter1.greet('Tony');



This is a key concept in node. Many objects in node can do many things plus listen for and emit events.

Here is another example that waits for async random number requests to be generated.

numEvents.js:

    // extends the events lib to handle random number events
    const util = require('util');
    const EventEmitter = require('events');
    const eventConfig = require('./config2').events;

    function NumEventer() {
        // add in a call to the super constructor if you also need some 
        // properties generated only in that constructor
        // EventEmitter.call(this);
    }

    const numRequest = function() {
        setTimeout(() => {
            const randomNum = Math.random();
            this.emit(eventConfig.NUM_REC, randomNum);
        }, 2000);
    }

    util.inherits(NumEventer, EventEmitter);

    NumEventer.prototype.on(eventConfig.NUM_REC, function(numData) {
        console.log(`Your percentage is: ${(numData*100).toPrecision(2)} %`);
    });

    NumEventer.prototype.request = function() {
        numRequest.call(this);
        console.log('Sent a request for random number');
    };

    module.exports = NumEventer;

app.js

    const NumEventer = require('./numEvents');
    const numEventer = new NumEventer();

    // request a random number from the "net"
    numEventer.request();


Here is another example of utils along with comlete inheritance. This a sommon pattern in nodejs

    const util = require('util');

    function Person() {
        this.firstName = "John";
        this.lastName = "Doe";
    }

    Person.prototype.greet = function() {
        console.log(`Hello ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`);
    }

    function PoliceOfficer() {
        // Because this is a function constructor an empty object is assigned to 'this'
        Person.call(this); // attach properties to `this` from the super constructor
        this.badgeNumer = 1234;
    }

    // make the prototype of the prototype for police objects the same prototype
    // that Person objects have.
    util.inherits(PoliceOfficer, Person);

    const officer = new PoliceOfficer();

    // name properties inherited
    officer.greet(); // Hello John Doe

    // greet is on the proto of the proto!
    officer.__proto__.__proto__.greet(); // Hello undefined undefined
